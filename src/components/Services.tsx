            Versitel Phones specialises in the supply, installation and support of hosted VoIP telephone systems and SMS messaging services.
          </p>
          <p className="services-explanation">
            What this means is that a Versitel system is different from a traditional phone system in two main areas...

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>First, the connection of your telephones to the global public phone network is handled by a data connection rather than by traditional analogue or ISDN connections. This gives you reduced line rental costs, especially if you have a significant number of incoming lines.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="step-card">
            <div className="step-number">2</div>
            <h3>VoIP Telephony</h3>
            <p>Second, the actual switching of phone calls is not carried out on your premises.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="step-card">
            <div className="step-number">3</div>
            <h3>Call Capacity</h3>
            <p>So, instead of the traditional concept of you having your own private telephone switch (PBX) on your premises, all the switching functions are carried out centrally.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="step-card">
            <div className="step-number">4</div>
            <h3>Advantage Of Hosted</h3>
            <p>We provide a soft-switch which in reality is a cluster of computer servers and related hardware all located in a secure data centre. For resilience, the whole of the core switching system is duplicated in a second, geographically separated data centre as well.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="step-card">
            <div className="step-number">5</div>
            <h3>SMS Integration</h3>
            <p>Beyond voice communications, our platform seamlessly integrates SMS messaging services, allowing you to send and receive text messages through the same unified system. Perfect for notifications, alerts, and customer communications.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="step-card">
            <div className="step-number">6</div>
            <h3>Phones Anywhere</h3>
            <p>All of this adds up to reduced costs and increased flexibility for both voice and SMS communications.</p>
